  I can only garuntee myself, Michael H, will be cooperative though. Ask me anything.

Liscence:
  I really don't care who uses it, or for what. This was just a project for a class. I'm sure the substance library has some liscence or something. I never checked, nor do I really care.

  This is all free though.
